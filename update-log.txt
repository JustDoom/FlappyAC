- change flag to output config option to output to console or something

- More checks
- Ban wave
- viaversion compat
- checks run on new thread (does packetevents do this?)
- view player profile command (player client brand, violations etc)
- GUI for enabling checks etc
- lag back feature??? Could be an extension
- proper 1.8 - 1.16 support possibly
- alert interval
- max ping (add with pingspoof check)
- possibly customizable buffer
- discord integration
- include ban config for easy switch, could be on discord or with download
- maybe create a website that lets you edit the config easily (change from kick punishments to ban punishments quickly)
