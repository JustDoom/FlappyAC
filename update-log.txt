- better fly check

- change flag to output config option to output to console or something

- More checks
- Ban wave
- ViaVersion compat
- Checks run on new thread (does packetevents do this?)
- View player profile command (player client brand, violations etc)
- GUI for enabling checks etc
- Lag back feature/cancel??? Could be an extension
- Proper 1.8 - 1.17 support possibly
- Alert interval
- Max ping (add with pingspoof check)
- Possibly customizable buffer
- Discord integration
- Stop certain client brands joining
- Include ban config for easy switch, could be on discord or with download
- Maybe create a website that lets you edit the config easily (change from kick punishments to ban punishments quickly)
- Better way to get values from config
- 1.17 support
- disable op bypass?
- worldguard support because has to many issues (groundspoof breaking below block and badpackets (a or b?) when attacking)
