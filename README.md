# FlappyAC
 
Flappy-Anticheat is an anticheat I'm making to learn how anticheats and packets work. If anyone wants to help out you can report false flags, suggestions or help out with pull requests.
I doubt this will become good enough to be used for any proper server, but I'm hoping to have fun developing this at least.

I will learn the basics of anticheats while using events then recode it with packets eventually.

And yes I know this code probably burns your eyes, but I will make it better as I learn this (and more java)

Im using PacketEvents by retrooper.

I will post compiled versions of the plguin in my [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wVCSqV7ptB).
