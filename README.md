FlappyAC is a free anticheat, I started it because I wanted to learn anticheat development as it seemed fun (And it was!). FlappyAC aims to support Minecraft versions 1.8+ and should work on Spigot and any forks that don't mess with packet stuff like TacoSpigot (I think). 

This may not receive any more updates anymore as I don't really have motivation for this any more. Anyone is welcome to fork this and continue it or use it as "inspiration" for there anticheat as long as I get some credit.

## Why use FlappyAC?
- Compatible with 1.8 - 1.19 servers (Soon:tm:)
- It will be free forever!
- It has an API you can use to develop addons!
